# Key Value Memory Networks

This repo contains the implementation of [Key Value Memory Networks for Directly Reading Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03126) in Tensorflow. The model is tested on [bAbI](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05698).

### Tutorial
- There is a [must-read tutorial](http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/icml2016/) on Memory Networks for NLP from Jason Weston @ ICML 2016.

- [[Video](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2016_chopra_attention_memory/)] [[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_hO8cnpcIMgYnlsMFlGSkxRLUk/view?usp=sharing)]
Sumit Chopra, from Facebook AI, gave a lecture about Reasoning, Attention and Memory at Deep Learning Summer School 2016.

### Get Started

```
git clone https://github.com/siyuanzhao/key-value-memory-networks.git

mkdir ./key-value-memory-networks/key_value_memory/logs
mkdir ./key-value-memory-networks/key_value_memory/data/
cd ./key-value-memory-networks/key_value_memory/data
wget http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/babi/tasks_1-20_v1-2.tar.gz
tar xzvf ./tasks_1-20_v1-2.tar.gz

cd ../
python single.py
```

### Usage

#### Running a [single bAbI task](./key_value_memory/single.py)

```
# Train the model on a single task <task_id>
python single.py --task_id <task_id>
```
There are serval flags within single.py. Below is an example of training the model on task 20 with specific learning rate, feature_size and epochs.
```
python single.py --task_id 20 --learning_rate 0.005 --feature_size 40 --epochs 200
```
Check all avaiable flags with the following command.
```
python single.py -h
```
#### Running a [joint model on all bAbI tasks](./key_value_memory/joint.py)
```
python joint.py
```
There are also serval flags within joint.py. Below is an example of training the joint model with specific learning rate, feature_size and epochs.
```
python joint.py --learning_rate 0.005 --feature_size 40 --epochs 200
```
Check all avaiable flags with the following command.
```
python joint.py -h
```
### Results
